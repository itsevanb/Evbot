Create a config.py file to store your OpenAI API key:
python
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
Make sure to replace 'your-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key. This file should not be added to version control.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to interact with the chatbot.
